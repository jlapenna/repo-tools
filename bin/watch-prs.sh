# Watch armed PRs until every one merges or any one needs attention.
#
# The single-run monitor (fleet-watch-run) answers "did this CI run pass?";
# this script answers the auto-merge lifecycle question an agent session
# actually has after `gh pr merge --auto`: "did my PRs land, and if not,
# what do I need to fix?" It polls each PR and exits the moment anything
# needs a human/agent (a DIRTY merge state, a failed check, a close
# without merge) — or with success once every watched PR has merged.
#
# Designed to run as a BACKGROUND task in an agent session: the exit
# re-invokes the agent with the verdict on stdout, so nothing sits
# unnoticed. Failure detection matters most — an armed PR whose Verify
# fails will otherwise wait silently forever (auto-merge never fires and
# nothing pings the session; this exact gap cost hours on #4211/#4230).
#
# Usage:
#   watch-prs.sh [--strict] [--interval <seconds>] <pr-number> [<pr-number>...]
#
# Output: one timestamped line per state change, then a final verdict:
#   VERDICT ALL-MERGED                          (exit 0)
#   VERDICT ATTENTION <pr> <reason>             (exit 2)
# <reason> is always a single whitespace-free token, so a consumer may parse
# the verdict positionally. Check names are sanitized to preserve that (see
# sanitize_names below) — real names here contain spaces ("E2E Tests").
# Reasons: dirty (needs rebase), behind (only with --strict — update
# the branch), checks-failed:<names> (failed OR cancelled required checks),
# unresolved-threads:<n> (green checks but dangling review threads — under
# required_review_thread_resolution auto-merge waits forever; resolve them
# per the repo's pr.md GraphQL recipe), closed-unmerged.
#
# Requires: gh (authenticated). Poll cost is two `gh` calls per PR per
# interval; the default 120s keeps that well inside rate limits.
#
# This is the fleet's single copy (packages/fleet-tools, agent-lcars#1328):
# consumer repos hold no copies -- the package installs it on PATH as
# `fleet-watch-prs` (workstations via a global pnpm install tracking main,
# the runner image at image build). The script is fully repo-neutral (repo
# identity is discovered from cwd), so no parameterization hook is needed.
